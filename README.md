Deaths by suicide has become the leading reason globally among various age groups and various ethnic and diverse communities (or, demography). The main motivation behind proceeding with this project is to find any sort of relationship between suicidal tendencies and happiness index (HI) or GDP of a country. 

Out of more curiosity, I would like to investigate further into the below questionable areas which I would like to figure out from tools like R and Tableau moving forward:

1. Is there any effect on the rate of deaths by suicide by the components like GDPI and the Mental Health Disorder Index of a country?
2. Does economy of a country depend on the happiness index of a country?
3. Is there any link between how happy a citizen think themselves to be and the rate of suicides? Or in simpler words, the relation between Suicidal Death rates and        the Happiness Index of a country.

The whole report is present in the pdf along with the codes attached.
